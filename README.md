`english--` is a logic-oriented programming language based on a controlled subset of english.

The compiler takes a controlled subset of the english language and compiles to a lower level logic language. The interpretation of the language are largely inspired by [Discourse Representation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_representation_theory).
